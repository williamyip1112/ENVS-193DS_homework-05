# ENVS-193DS_homework-05

Contains code for homework 5 where a data set from effects of prey availability on sarracenia physiology at Harvard Forest were used to answer the question: How do Sarracenia characteristics predict biomass?? The dataset comes from this the EDI data portal: https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/26b22d09279e62fd729ffc35f9ef0174 (Accessed 2023-06-05).

The data file stores the dataset where the data comes from and the code folder stores the code for the homework including code for the visualizations and tests we ran. We created full, null, and additional models to see what biological components of sarrencia predicted biomass.
